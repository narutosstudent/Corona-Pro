                            Li Wenliang was a Chinese ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital who on 30 December 2019 warned his colleagues about a possible outbreak of an illness that resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), later acknowledged as COVID-19. He became a whistleblower when his warnings were later shared publicly. On 3 January 2020, Wuhan police summoned and admonished him for "making false comments on the Internet". Li returned to work, later contracted the virus from an infected patient and died from the disease on 7 February 2020, at age 33.
